                <h2>TOUR TOKYO</h2>
                <span><!-- line here --></span>

                <p>Japanese schoolchildren on class trips typically visit Tokyo Tower. Cultural offerings in Tokyo include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center. Tokyo National Museum houses over a third of the National Treasures of Japan. No buildings in Tokyo are listed as World heritage sites. Among buildings, only the Jizo Hall of Shofuku-ji, a suburban temple, is a National treasure. Other popular attractions include the Imperial Palace, Meiji Shrine, and Sens≈ç-ji, a popular temple. Many tourists, particularly foreigners, visit Tsukiji Fish Market. Contrary to a common misconception, Tokyo has many green spaces in the city center and its suburbs.</p>
